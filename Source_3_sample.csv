The car remembers 'All Sensors' and 'ask on exit' but the perimeter selection is only good for one lock - unlock cycle. Why even bother having the prompt at all? It leads people to believe that you can have perimeter sensors set as a default so when you leave your dogs in the car they don't continually set the alarm off. I am not sure I would have bought the car if I had known ahead of time that I could not permanently set the alarm default to perimeter only.

15825,(Copied from AEN97): 1) The radio controls being on the right side of the steering are very annoying. These controls should be on the left side of the steering wheel to allow for better control of the audio system. (ala pre F01/2009 7 series design)  2) The rotary wheel for advancing music track selection should also allow for 'Previous' and 'Next' track. This makes Next track selection with the bluetooth/USB feature impossible with the steering wheel controls and the next track must be selected via the I-drive controller or ASK buttons.  3) The 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons for the audio system are on the very right side of the audio system control panel (ASK). This makes quick track stations very difficult without having to reach into the passenger's area.

That individual indicated they had a bulletin re that problem and it would probably rectify itself in about 80 minutes and it did. That individual gave me his phone number to call if the matter did not clear on its own. He also sent me an email with his number etc.  On the following Monday he called me with a follow-up to make sure the problem was still  OK  and had not reoccurred.. I was impressed with the follow-up call even though I had replied to his earlier email that the problem had automatically corrected as he indicated it would.

This happens more frequently than it should even on the clearest days with no clouds in the sky or anything overhead that could be possibly blocking a signal. There is also a distinct/significant difference in the sound quality between the XM stations and tuner/FM stations. When you go from a XM channel to a FM channel the FM's sound/music is significantly lower and the volume needs to be increased more than you should have to in order to match the volume/sound of the XM channels. This is even with the HD option selected in the settings menu for sound quality.

Basically what happens is if the passenger seat is unoccupied, and you place any small items that has metal  (namely sunglasses or the phone charging cable) on the seat, the sensor activates the chime.   It is an annoying chime that we now just ignore.

If you compare the MB maps to Apple or Google Maps, you will see a drastic difference in color and ease of reading the map. Second, the routes it take you on are round-about and out of the way. I drive in the New York area and have had so many instances where the navigation system proposed a strange or indirect route. Third, it doesn't let you select the route you want as you can do if using your phone with Google or Apple maps. It should show you the route in an overview before executing it and give you a choice. Forth, the system talks too much!! It becomes annoying hearing it say too many commands, repeating over & over. I hate that MB forces you to choose between Apple Car Play and this more expensive system in the C class.  I should be able to have BOTH and would be easier with TOUCH SCREEN like XX has! (Copied from AEN97): I don't like how the audio system operates with a Joy Stick.  The dealer did tell me that Touch Screens are not available in any Mercedes as they think if the driver is leaning over to touch it, the body is in an unsafe position.  I think that's ridiculous!  Almost every car in the US has a touch screen, including my other car, a 2017 Buick Envision.  The navigation system & Apple Car play in XX cars is MUCH better than Mercedes.
