 I can't use it to access addresses - voice or on screen - (Ex - drive to Dr. Jones).  3) When I put in a name (say Dr. Jones) to have the Nav system search for the address, it gives me addresses on the east coast.

I don't want to use voice command when other people are in the car - it is confusing and/or I have to 'hush' them so I can speak. That's rude.

 the response is 'loading Map' or something like that, but nothing is ever loaded and I get no navigation help. (Copied from AEN97): I explained this previously.  The navigation system never loads the map."
 the response was quick and you didn't even need the route spoken turn by turn because the complete view of the map made it so easy to see where you were going and what roads you may want to choose. (Copied from FCD97): The navigation system is extremely awkward compared to the 2013 Yukon I had. The display is not user friendly, the views and response time isn't the same. I find myself now not even looking at navigation as much as I used to and plotting out my routes from the computer (mapquest)."

 they advance to the next station on the frequency (not preset). Steering wheel radio controls in most cars operate such that a quick press of the < or > button advances to the next PRESET station and pressing and holding the < or > button advances to the next station on the FREQUENCY.

See the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-lB9Uyr3NY (at the 0:57 mark). This is clearly a flaw in Jaguar's system design.

2017. Had we've been told in December we would not have leased the car. (Copied from DEXP97): The issue is with using the Handsfree system. When accessing the phone the name comes up unknown on the display and there is no voice recognition on incoming calls. On a separate issue the Text messaging does not work at all. We have been in touch with the Handsfree team and the Dealership and this has not been fixed. This is a SAFETY PROBLEM and must been fixed. This Dealer has known about this since September 2017 and we leased the car on December 8th,2017. Had we've been told in December we would not have leased the car."
